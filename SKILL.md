# Evening Reflection (Self-Examination)

A structured end-of-day review to learn from experience, build self-awareness, and drive continuous improvement.

---

## When to Use

- End of day review and learning
- After significant events or experiences
- When seeking to build a self-examination habit
- Processing difficult interactions or decisions
- User asks "Help me reflect on today" or "What did I learn today?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| day_overview | Yes | What happened today (key events, interactions, decisions) |
| challenges_faced | No | Difficulties encountered |
| emotions_experienced | No | How the user felt throughout the day |
| goals_for_day | No | What they had intended to accomplish |

---

## The Stoic Framework

The Stoics practiced rigorous self-examination. As Seneca described his evening practice:

> "When the light has been removed and my wife has fallen silent, aware of this habit that's now mine, I examine my entire day and go back over what I've done and said, hiding nothing from myself, passing nothing by."

### The Purpose

Evening reflection serves multiple functions:
1. **Learning:** Extract wisdom from experience
2. **Accountability:** Hold yourself to your standards
3. **Self-knowledge:** Understand your patterns and tendencies
4. **Improvement:** Identify specific areas for growth
5. **Closure:** Process the day before sleep

### Marcus Aurelius's Guidance

> "Those who do not observe the movements of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy."

The unexamined day disappears. The examined day teaches.

---

## Reflection Steps

### Step 1: Recall the Day
Walk through the day chronologically. What happened? Who did you interact with? What decisions did you make?

### Step 2: Identify Moments of Virtue
Where did you act well? When did you embody wisdom, courage, justice, or temperance? This is not vanity—it's recognizing what to continue.

### Step 3: Identify Moments of Falling Short
Where did you fail to meet your standards? Be honest but not harsh. The goal is learning, not self-flagellation.

### Step 4: Examine Root Causes
For shortcomings: What led to that behavior? False judgment? Emotional reaction? Lack of preparation? Fatigue?

### Step 5: Extract the Lesson
What did today teach you? What will you do differently?

### Step 6: Set Tomorrow's Intention
Based on today's learning, what specific intention will you carry into tomorrow?

## Example

**Input:** "Today I had a conflict with a colleague about project direction. I got frustrated and said something dismissive in front of the team. Later I felt bad about it. I also finished a big deliverable I'm proud of."

**Output:**

## Evening Reflection

### Day Overview
Completed significant deliverable. Conflict with colleague about project direction escalated in team meeting—said something dismissive. Mixed feelings about the day's balance.

### Moments of Virtue

| Situation | Virtuous Action | Virtue Demonstrated |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| Major deliverable | Focused effort, completed quality work despite distractions | Temperance (discipline) |
| After the conflict | Recognized wrongdoing, felt remorse | Wisdom (self-awareness) |
| Colleague's criticism | Underneath, their point had merit—I can acknowledge this now | Justice (giving due credit) |

### Moments of Falling Short

| Situation | What Happened | Root Cause | Lesson |
|-----------|--------------|------------|--------|
| Team meeting | Said something dismissive to colleague | Ego threatened by public disagreement; reacted emotionally | Disagreement in public ≠ attack on me; respond to substance, not feeling |
| In front of team | Made colleague look foolish | Wanted to "win" rather than resolve | My victory created their defeat—now we both lose |

### Self-Examination Questions

**Did I do my best work today?**
Yes, on the deliverable. No, in managing the conflict—I could have paused, listened, responded thoughtfully.

**Did I treat others well?**
Not my colleague. I treated their idea as beneath consideration rather than engaging seriously.

**Did I waste time on what I cannot control?**
Yes—spent energy after the meeting ruminating about whether they were "right" to challenge me. Their challenge was not mine to control; my response was.

**Did I act in alignment with my values?**
Partially. The work reflected my values. The conflict did not. I value respectful disagreement and I failed to practice it.

### What Today Taught Me
When I feel publicly challenged, I default to dismissiveness. This is a pattern worth watching. The feeling of being challenged is not the same as being attacked. I can disagree without diminishing.

### Tomorrow's Intention
**I will:** Apologize to my colleague sincerely and engage with their actual point
**Because:** This repairs the relationship and demonstrates the integrity I failed to show today

### Closing Thought
> "The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury." — Marcus Aurelius

Tonight, I recognize that I performed an injury. Tomorrow, I can be unlike that version of myself.
